## Learning Preferences

### Involvement Level

These preferences can change during the project—if a component feels tedious or you want more challenge, just say so.

*Note on "typing": We use "typing code" to mean the mechanical task of translating a well-understood design into correct C. "Writing code" includes all the thinking and design work. Claude doesn't have hands, but can do the typing part for you.*

**Design approach:** *(To be determined in first session)*
- **Student-led** – You read documentation, identify design questions, and develop approaches independently; consult Claude on specific questions as needed
- **Collaborative** – You and Claude explore design together; Claude points out considerations, you propose approaches; back-and-forth discussion
- **Claude-led** – Claude identifies decision points and guides you through them; you discuss and choose between approaches in English/pseudocode

**Code typing:** *(To be determined in first session)*
- **Claude types** – Claude writes almost all C code; you're still engaged on structural choices (error handling, code organization, etc.)
- **Key pieces** – Claude scaffolds the structure; you type the conceptually important parts
- **Student types** – You write most or all C code; Claude advises and reviews

*Current settings:*
- Design approach: ___
- Code typing: ___

### Other Preferences

**Explanation style:**
*(e.g., "Prefers seeing code first" or "Likes conceptual overview before diving in")*

**Pacing:**
*(e.g., "Wants to move quickly" or "Prefers thorough exploration")*

**Diagram support:** *(Can render Mermaid: Yes/No)*
