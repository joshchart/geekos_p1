# Code Review Checklist

This is a living document of coding practices and things to check when writing or reviewing code. Items are added through discussions during tutoring sessions - when you notice a pattern, catch a bug, or develop a preference, it gets recorded here.

**How to use:** Review this before committing code. Claude will also reference it when writing or reviewing code.
